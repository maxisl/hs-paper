%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}
  \sloppy
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in the daily lives of
  millions of people.
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most prominent implementations of AI that are used
  not only by experts, but equally by ordinary users as well.
  LLMs can respond to any textual input (prompts) with human-like answers, leveraging the
  training data that was used to implement the model.
  Even though prompting LLMs seems very straightforward, the question arises if it is possible
  to streamline the interactions with said models in order to optimize outputs.
  We investigate user behavior in interactions with LLMs based on a randomized trial of 100
  samples that are publicly available on the platforms ShareGPT and Midjourney.
  The goal of this analysis is the discovery of recurring patterns as well as the
  evaluation of human tendencies and biases when interacting with AI models in
  order to understand prevalent behaviors and explore optimization opportunities.
