\subsection{Large Language Models (LLMs)}
\label{subsec:large-language-models-(llms)}

One of the most widely used applications areas of generative AI today are Large Language Models.
Among LLMs, the most widely adopted is ChatGPT~\cite{openai_chatgpt_2023}, which is a
conversational model being developed by OpenAI\@.
The model is currently publicly accessible free of charge.

% What is an LLM? What does it look like?
LLMs can be leveraged for a variety of tasks, but their main focus area is Natural Language Processing
(NLP).
Therefore, most LLMs designed for end users are implemented as a chatbots, as is the case with ChatGPT
for example.
They typically consist of an interface made up of an input field for the user to type in arbitrary text, as well as
an output section that displays generated responses of the model.

% How does an LLM / ChatGPT work?
Large Language Models gained traction after the development of the original transformer architecture,
which is a deep learning approach first introduced by researchers in 2017~\cite{vaswani_attention_2017}.
Based on this architecture, the Generative Pre-Training (GPT)~\cite{radford_improving_2018} approach
was developed for text-based models in particular, which is the foundation for today's most popular
conversational LLMs, such as ChatGPT\@.
Since our research revolves around user interaction with dialog-focused models, we will not go into
more detail about other application and development areas of LLMs.
In addition to ChatGPT, there are also a variety of similar other models focused on text generation,
such as LaMDA~\cite{thoppilan_lamda_2022}, Sparrow~\cite{glaese_improving_2022}, or
BlenderBot 3~\cite{shuster_blenderbot_2022}.
