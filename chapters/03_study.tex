\section{Study on Usage Patterns of LLM Users}
\label{sec:study-on-usage-patterns-of-llm-users}

% Ideas for language prompt coding categories:
%- Prompt type: could include questions, statements, commands, or specific task-based prompts
%- User intent: could include seeking information, asking for advice, requesting clarification,
% expressing opinions, or making suggestions
%- Response quality: might include accurate and helpful responses, incomplete or ambiguous
% responses, irrelevant responses, or responses requiring further clarification
%- User satisfaction: could include satisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, confused, or impressed
%- Engagement level: might include active conversation, single-turn interactions, probing for
% more information, or exploratory questioning
%- Task success: could include successful completion, partial success, or failure
%- Response length
%- Ethical considerations: might include potential biases in the generated responses, adherence
% to ethical guidelines, or fairness and inclusivity in the LLM's behavior

% % Ideas for image prompt coding categories:
% Prompt type: capture the types of inputs users provide to the image generation models
% User intent: Extend the user intent category to encompass image-related intents--could
% include users requesting image generation, describing desired visual characteristics, or
% seeking specific visual outcomes.
% Response quality: evaluate the quality of the generated images--consider aspects such as visual
% fidelity, realism, relevance to the user's request, or adherence to given guidelines.
% User satisfaction: not possible? maybe on discord (but hard to discern)
% Engagement level: might involve exploring how users refine their requests, provide feedback on
% generated images, or iteratively interact with the model to achieve their desired visual
% outcomes. (hard to discern, same as above)
% Task success: might include successful image generation, partially successful
% results, or cases where the model failed to meet the user's expectations.
% Ethical considerations: could involve examining issues such as biases in generated images,
% ethical implications of content creation, privacy concerns related to user-provided images, or
% responsible use of image generation models.

% analysis: do we see differences between text and image prompts? which is more successful /
% accurate in general? do we observe sentiment differences?

% Analyze distribution of zero-, one-, and few-shot prompts
% analyze frequency of prompt reformulations in order to improve results

\subsection{Research Objective}
\label{subsec:research-objective}
% Intro and Research Objective of the study goal, the methodology, and the individual
% steps that will be taken
The main outlined goal of our research to gain a fundamental understanding of user
interaction in conversation with Large Language Models.
This analysis includes identifying common patterns and strategies in those interactions.
Previous research indicates, that users regularly face challenges and difficulties, especially
when trying to formulate effective prompts.
Through analysis of qualified data samples we aim to identify and understand these
challenges,
as well as investigate the impact and effect of user behavior on the effectiveness of LLM responses.
Given the various kinds of available generative models, we want to examine differences in
prompting behavior according to model type as well.

Since related insights suggest that reformulating search queries is a popular strategy to improve
results, we want to investigate if users apply this strategy in LLM conversations as well. % TODO
% check if we really did this
Furthermore, we want to assess extent to which users show awareness of effective prompt
formulation strategies, such as few-shot learning, and whether they rely on appropriate language
that is machine and not human directed, thus showing comprehension of the fundamental difference
between talking to a machine versus a human.
