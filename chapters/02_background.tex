\subsection{Large Language Models (LLMs)}
\label{subsec:large-language-models-(llms)}

There are many applications of generative AI, but the most widely used today are Large Language Models.
Among these LLMs, the most widely adopted is ChatGPT~\cite{openai_chatgpt_2023}, which is being
developed by OpenAI\@.
The model is currently publicly accessible free of charge. % TODO cite

% What is an LLM? What does it look like?
As is the case with ChatGPT, most LLMs designed for end users are implemented as a chatbot.
They typically consist of an interface made up of an input field for the user to type in arbitrary text, as well as
an output area that displays generated responses of the model.

% How does an LLM / ChatGPT work?
ChatGPT is based on a transformer architecture % TODO cite
and therefore leverages neural networks in order to be able to dynamically generate responses according
to user inputs.
