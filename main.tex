\begin{abstract}
  A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an
  article formatted for publication by ACM in a conference proceedings
  or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
  article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
  as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
  preparation of the documentation of their work.

%\section{Title Information}
%
%The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
%\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
%capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
%your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
%{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.
%
%If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
%in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
%command has a ``short title'' parameter:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \title[short title]{full title}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\section{Authors and Affiliations}
%
%Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
%identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
%names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
%possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.
%
%Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
%alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
%  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
%  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
%to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
%of an article contributed equally to the work.
%
%If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
%the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
%overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
%the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
%\end{verbatim}
%Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
%of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
%page headers.
%
%The article template's documentation, available at
%\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
%complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
%use.
%
%Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.
%
%\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}
%
%Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
%taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
%search.
%
%The ACM Computing Classification System ---
%\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
%classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
%discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
%system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
%commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.
%
%User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
%of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
%the research being presented.
%
%CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
%articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
%two-page articles (or abstracts).
%
%\section{Sectioning Commands}
%
%Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
%\verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
%\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
%from the commands.
%
%Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
%a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}
%
%\section{Tables}
%
%The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
%package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
%high-quality tables.
%
%Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.
%
%Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
%them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
%ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
%environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
%table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
%\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
%columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
%detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
%\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.
%
%Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
%placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
%this document.
%
%\begin{table}
%  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%  \label{tab:freq}
%  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%    \toprule
%    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%    \midrule
%    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%  \bottomrule
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}
%
%To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
%live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
%contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
%wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
%desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
%instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
%in the printed output of this document.
%
%\begin{table*}
%  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%  \label{tab:commands}
%  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%    \toprule
%    Command &A Number & Comments\\
%    \midrule
%    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%    \bottomrule
%  \end{tabular}
%\end{table*}
%
%Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
%use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
%recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
%more easily.
%
%\section{Math Equations}
%You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
%inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
%discussed in the next sections.
%
%\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
%in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
%which can be invoked with the usual
%\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
%the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
%and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
%\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
%examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
%\begin{math}
%  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
%\end{math},
%set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
%set in display style.  (See next section).
%
%\subsection{Display Equations}
%A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
%text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
%environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
%\textbf{displaymath} environment.
%
%Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
%structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
%of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
%equation, shown as an inline equation above:
%\begin{equation}
%  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
%\end{equation}
%Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
%the \textbf{displaymath}
%environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
%\begin{displaymath}
%  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
%\end{displaymath}
%and follow it with another numbered equation:
%\begin{equation}
%  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
%\end{equation}
%just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.
%
%\section{Figures}
%
%The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
%more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
%third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
%in the example below.
%\begin{figure}[h]
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/sample-franklin}
%  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
%\end{figure}
%
%Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
%the reader.
%
%Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.
%
%Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
%decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
%who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
%indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.
%
%A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
%characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
%  should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
%  important information that is not already provided in the caption or
%  the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
%complex new information, a short text description may not be
%adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
%appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
%provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
%structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
%regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
%so important, please see
%\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.
%
%\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}
%
%A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
%are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
%the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
%figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
%\verb|\maketitle| command:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \begin{teaserfigure}
%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%    \caption{figure caption}
%    \Description{figure description}
%  \end{teaserfigure}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\section{Citations and Bibliographies}
%
%The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
%references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
%--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
%(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
%reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
%article DOI, etc.
%
%The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
%commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%  \bibliography{bibfile}
%\end{verbatim}
%where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
%suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.
%
%Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
%ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
%``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
%command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
%``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%  book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
%  conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
%  article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
%  all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
%  proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
%  \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
%    AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
%  master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
%  resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
%  (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
