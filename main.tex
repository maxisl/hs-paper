\begin{abstract}
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in the daily lives of millions of people.
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are the most prominent implementation of AI that is used not only by experts, but equally by ordinary users as well.
  LLMs can respond to any textual input (prompts) with human-like answers, leveraging the training data that was used to implement the model.
  Even though prompting LLMs seems very straightforward, the question arises if it is possible to streamline the interactions with said models in order to optimize outputs.
  We explore the behavior of a randomized trial of 100 interactions of users with LLMs that are publicly available on ShareGPT\@.
  The goal of this investigation is the discovery of recurring patterns in behavior and the evaluation of human tendencies as well as biases of users when interacting with AI models in order to understand current behaviors and propose optimization opportunities.

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

%\section{Citations and Bibliographies}
%
%The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
%references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
%--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
%(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
%reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
%article DOI, etc.
%
%The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
%commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%  \bibliography{bibfile}
%\end{verbatim}
%where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
%suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.
%
%Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
%ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
%``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
%command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
%``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%  book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
%  conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
%  article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
%  all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
%  proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
%  \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
%    AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
%  master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
%  resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
%  (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
%  and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
%  publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%  \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
%  contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
%  \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
%  multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
%  couple of citations with DOIs:
%  \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
%  citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}. Artifacts:
